    I worked as a research assistant at HPCN Lab at the CSE department. My research focus was on high-performance throughput optimization between high-performance computers of [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/ecosystem/resources). I developed a stream file transfer client using JAVA, [GridFTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GridFTP), and [JGlobus API](https://github.com/jglobus/JGlobus) to find optimized network conditions and perform real-time profiling to achieve maximum possible throughput.
