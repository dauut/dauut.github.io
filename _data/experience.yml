    I was involved in an ongoing research project about creating a distributed social network in 2014. 
    The project was using personal cloud accounts like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. for the storage. 
    So, I developed a performance tester application that can test upload/download speeds from cloud services at 
    different internet connection hubs. Also, I developed a social media feed simulation in 2018 for this project.
