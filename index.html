      <p> I worked as an intern on a big data project during my last academic term. The project was about finding optimized solutions to data throughput on HBase. The HBase(NoSQL database) is working on a distributed Hadoop environment, so I created and maintained a distributed Hadoop system which had five nodes. The primary purpose was finding the best HBase configuration sets according to data size. I tuned up memstore, and garbage collector of Hbase then tested the various size of big data datasets.</p>
