  I am a self-motivated, result-oriented and 2.5+ years experienced software engineer. Also, I am interested in state-of-the-art technologies and have a passion for problem-solving. Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the High-Performance Computing and Networking Lab(HPCN) and developing high-performance throughput applications to find optimized ways to transfer large datasets between high-end sites.
